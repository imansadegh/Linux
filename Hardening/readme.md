## Hardening
The importance of securing digital assets has become increasingly crucial as technology continues to advance and integrate into our daily lives.
While the Linux operating system is known for its security features, it is not 100% secure. 
Threats like malware, cyber-attacks, and data breaches can have devastating consequences, 
making it essential to take steps to harden the security of your Linux server. 
Some important steps include keeping software up-to-date, implementing firewalls and access controls, monitoring activity,
and regularly backing up data. Additionally,
using strong passwords and enabling multi-factor authentication can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
To further harden the security of your Linux server, consider using a bash script to automate many of the security-hardening tasks,
such as disabling root login over SSH, disabling password authentication, setting up a firewall, and saving firewall rules.
By taking these steps, you can improve the security of your Linux server and reduce the risk of security breaches.

I wrote the following bash file for myself and the first thing I do after installing the Linux servers is to run the following file that
I am giving you and I hope you will use it too.
